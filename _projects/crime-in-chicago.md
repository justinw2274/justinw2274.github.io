## Making Sense of Crime in Chicago

This public dashboard explores crime in Chicago over the past year, with a special focus on theft. By tracking theft counts month by month, the interactive chart helps users intuitively observe trends in property crime.

To add broader context, we examine both the most frequently reported offenses (top 10 crime types by raw count) and how quickly different crimes are cleared by law enforcement (arrest rate). Seeing both frequency and clearance provides a more nuanced picture of Chicago’s public-safety landscape.

Together, these visualizations empower residents, community leaders, and policymakers to make informed, data-driven decisions about where to focus prevention and enforcement efforts.
